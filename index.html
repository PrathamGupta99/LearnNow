            Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
            acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.
            Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling,
            discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place
            under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate
            themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings
            and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
            thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The
            methodology of teaching is called pedagogy education in zambia

            Many public schools provide a free education through the government.
            Parents may send their own children to a private schools, but they
            must pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot go to
            school, because their countries do not make education available in
            their countries, or because their families do not have enough money,
            or because the children have to work for money, or because the
            society have negative prejudice on education for girls.The city of
            Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to
            Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the
            great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE.
            European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and
            organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

            Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
            knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
            pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
            imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from
            one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their
            knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
            imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at
            the time of the Middle Kingdom. Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi
            (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in
            1607 Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of
            higher learning in Europe.
